README file for CS 5363 Project 1 submission

This parser currently recognizes all token types and language constructs as specified in the Project 1 guidelines.

This project was implemented using the Ruby language and leverages a Ruby Parser library called Treetop which is available as open source. 

You can find more information about Treetop at 

http://treetop.rubyforge.org/

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

- You must install Ruby on the system
   - Information on installing Ruby on Mac, Windows, Linux or Solaris can be found at:
       http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
   - This was developed using Ruby 1.9.2 on a Mac
   - I have also tested this on Ruby 1.8.6 and Ruby 1.8.7 on a Mac
- Once Ruby is installed you must install the Treetop gem
   - gem install treetop

- At this point you can run the program with the following command:

> ruby project1.rb

You will be prompted for an input file. I have provided "testinput.c" which contains the sample input from the project specification. I have also included "badtestinput.c" which has a syntax error and will be rejected by the parser.

CURRENT STATE OF THE COMPILER

	- The project is complete as specified.
	- Known bugs: None known. This is the second submission and fixed the error I pointed out in my initial submission.

PROJECT TESTING

I tested the program manually with the two input files mentioned above.

I also used TDD (test driven development) to build the program using a tool called Rspec. You can run the unit test by installing Rspec:

gem install rspec

and running the command (assuming you have installed rspec 2.0):

>rspec parser_spec.rb --format d

if you are running a prior version of rspec then the command is:

>spec parser_spec.rb --format specdoc

In parser_spec.rb, you will find the tests used on the project.
